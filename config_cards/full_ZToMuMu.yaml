### The different quality cuts to apply
Qualities:
    # <label>: <cut>
    # label is the string inserted in histogram and plot names
    # cut is the value of the cut to apply.
    # To select all the qualities, set the cut to -1.
    AllQual: -1
    Qual8:  8
    Qual12: 12
### The different of regions of eta
Regions:
    # <label>: [<low bound>, <high bound>]
    # label is the string inserted in histogram and plot names
    # low bound is the lowest value of abs(eta) for that region (inclusive)
    # high bound is the highest value of abs(eta) for that region (exclusive)
    #BMTF: [0.0, 0.83]
    OMTF: [0.83, 1.24]
    #EMTF: [1.24, 2.4]
    #EMTF1: [1.24, 1.6]
    #EMTF2: [1.6, 2.1]
    #EMTF3: [2.1, 2.4]
    AllEta: [0.0, 2.4]
### The thresholds to draw the turn-on of
# Thresholds: [<thr 1>, <thr 2>, ...]
# thr # are the different threshold values (in GeV) to use
Thresholds: [3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 22, 26]
### These are some boolean fields to select to compute and draw some plots or not
#   these fields need to exist, and must be set to either true or false.
# All the Turn On plots:
TurnOns: true
# Response vs Pt and vs Run Nb. These require the AllQual quality to be computed.
Response: false
# All the pre/post firing plots (vs Eta Phi, vs Eta, for Mu 10 to 21 and Mu 22)
Prefiring: false
# Efficiency vs Run Nb and vs Eta Phi
Efficiency: false
### Settings for the plots in bins of nvtx
PU_plots:
    # Whether or not to compute the histograms for each bin of nvtx.
    # this field needs to exist, and must be set to either true or false.
    make_histos: true
    # The bins of nvtx to use
    # nvtx_bins: [<bin 1>, <bin 2>, ...]
    # using this will make copies of each histogram for each bin
    # [<bin i>, <bin i+1>], with an inclusive low bound and exclusive high bound.
    nvtx_bins: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
    # These additionnal thresholds can be set, and only affect the plotting of the figures,
    # not the computing of the histograms. 
    # draw_thresholds: [<thr 1>, <thr 2>, ...]
    # For each thr #, a turn on figure will be made, 
    # comparing the turn on of this threshold accross all bins of nvtx
    # For this to be possible, make_histos has to be set to true
    draw_thresholds: [25]
#
#
#
# for debugging purposses
#TurnOns: false
#Efficiency: false
#Prefiring: false
#Response: false
